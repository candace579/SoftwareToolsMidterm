Static analysis tools would be  javadoc, cppcheck. I would categorize cppcheck as a static analysis tool as used in class. We had used working programs to check for memory leaks and false positives. This means the program was working but was giving incorrect answers.  Pro - it found false positives, which is really important in programming. Most IDEs don't catch those. Con - The tool doesn't go in to depth like visual studio on how to fix problems although it does let you know which line that is causing an issue.
Javadoc is static as well. We took jfreechart and ran Javadoc to create a HTML of the sourcecode. Pro - shows you the hierarchy which helps you better understand what is coming from where. Con - Doesn't show you much of the actual code. It is mostly just the hierarchy and exceptions and things like that. Shows you more names of things rather than what is inside it.


Dynamic analysis tools are discover and valgrind. Discover pro - can use for more than just linux. con - you have to use the SUN compiler for it to work best. The general report doesnt necessarily show you enough information. Valgrind pro - flexible with debugging and has a modular structure meaning that new tools can be created without losing integrity of what is already there. Also catches memory leaks. Con - only works with linux. 

b. I was going to use eclipse with the PMD plugin and then run jfreechart. I first went to the Eclipse Marketplace and downloaded the plugin there. I then opened the lib folder under jfreechart's download and enabled PMD for the project. I then ran the project with PMD and got the resulting errors. PMD is nice because you can run it on single parts of a program or the whole thing. I had both an outline and overview of the errors. Errors such as "button cannot be resolved a type" showed up under my SWTAxisEditor. You can also make rules for your program. Findbugs works regardless of if the program executes or not. You can run it anyway which is nice if you are trying to check your work along the way. Findbugs also showed you how many errors you had in the hierarchy on the left - that way you didn't have to click on them to figure out how many errors were in each program. Both are useful in their own way - you should usually use more than one analyzer.
